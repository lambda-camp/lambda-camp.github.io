# lambda-camp

## Description

The project aims to assist new students entering the field of Information Technology (IT) by providing a comprehensive guide that covers various areas within this rapidly expanding domain. As technology evolves, students often face uncertainty regarding which career path to pursue and what initial steps to take to achieve their goals. This guide serves as a supportive resource to help them navigate their options and make informed decisions, rather than dictating their success. It will cover a wide range of relevant topics for beginners in IT, from basic concepts to emerging trends and best practices.
